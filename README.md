# LaTeX-Like Macro Processor

## Project Overview

This project implements a **TeX-like macro processor** in C. The program reads an input text file (or standard input), processes **macro definitions and expansions**.

### Features
- Macro Definition & Expansion: Supports defining and using macros with arguments.
- Built-in Macros: Implements common TeX-like commands such as \def, \undef, \if, \ifdef, \include, and \expandafter.
- Recursive Expansion: Handles nested macro calls and substitutions correctly.
- File Inclusion: Allows including external files using \include.

### Example Execution

#### Input
```tex
% This defines a simple macro for greetings
\def{GREET}{Hello, #!} 

% Now, we use the macro with different arguments
\GREET{Alice}
\GREET{Bob}
```
#### Output
```tex
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
```
\def{GREET}{Hello, #!} defines GREET as Hello, #!, where # gets replaced by the macro's argument. When \GREET{Alice} is encountered, it expands to Hello, Alice!. 
Comments are defined using %, and are not outputted.

## Approach and Design

To implement a solution to this project, I used several key programming techniques.

#### 1. State Machine for Input Processing
A finite state machine (FSM) was used to parse input, handle macros, and track context. The tick() function maintains state variables using an enum to determine whether a character belongs to:
- Plain text
- A macro name
- A macro argument
- A comment (to be ignored)
- An escaped character

#### 2. Struct-Based Buffer and Macro Management
The processor stores text using struct-based buffers (line_t) that allow dynamic resizing.

#### 3. Linked Lists for Macro Storage
A linked list-based symbol table (macro_list_t) is used to store user-defined macros. Each macro entry (macro_t) contains:
- Macro name
- Macro replacement text
- Pointer to the next macro

#### 4. Recursive Expansion for Nested Macros
Since macros can expand into other macros, the processor recursively expands macros within expand_macro(). When a macro references another macro, the system:
- Fetches the stored macro value.
- Expands any nested macros within it.
- Continues processing until fully expanded.

## Solution Breakdown

The solution consists of three primary phases.

#### 1. Preprocessing Phase
- Reads input from multiple files and processes them sequentially.
- Removes comments (%) while keeping the rest of the text intact.
- Handles escape sequences (\, {, }, #, %).
- Stores preprocessed text in a dynamically allocated buffer (pre_buffer).
#### 2. Processing Phase
The macro processor:
- Scans the pre_buffer character by character.
- Identifies and extracts macro names and their arguments.
- Expands macros using a linked list (macro_list_t) that stores defined macros.
- Recursively replaces macro calls with their expanded values.
#### 3. Macro Expansion
When encountering a macro, the processor:
- Checks if it is built-in or user-defined.
- Retrieves its stored value from macro_list_t.
- Expands the macroâ€™s value while substituting its arguments (# placeholders).
